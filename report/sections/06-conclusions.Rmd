Regressions are useful because they can help predict what a response will be to varying levels of each of the predictors and the predictors can be set accordingly to obtain a deisred result. In order to get a more accurate forecast, the best model for the data has to be chosen. In this report, we explore five different regression methods to ultimately choose the one that has the lowest mean squared error. In other words, we are seacrhing for the regression model that predicts the response variable with the least error. After preforming the regressions and comparing their streadfastness, it is clear that the Ridge model is the best model to use for the regression.
